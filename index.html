                <p class="history">
                    Srinivasa Ramanujan, born in India in 1887, displayed exceptional mathematical aptitude from a young age. With limited formal education, including periods at Government Arts College and Pachaiyappa's College, he self-studied and independently explored complex mathematical concepts. His remarkable discoveries and innovative results led him to correspond with G.H. Hardy, a British mathematician from Trinity College, Cambridge, and eventually to study at Trinity College in England. Despite his lack of formal training, Ramanujan's insights and contributions to number theory and infinite series gained him recognition and admiration among mathematicians. Ramanujan's legacy endures as a testament to his innate talent, dedication, and profound impact on the field of mathematics.

                <p class="history">
                    Srinivasa Ramanujan is celebrated for his exceptional contributions to mathematics, encompassing a multitude of concepts such as Ramanujan's sum, Landau–Ramanujan constant, mock theta functions, Ramanujan conjecture, Ramanujan prime, Ramanujan–Soldner constant, Ramanujan theta function, Rogers–Ramanujan identities, Ramanujan's master theorem, Hardy–Ramanujan asymptotic formula, and Ramanujan–Sato series. These discoveries, characterized by their ingenuity and depth, have left an enduring impact on various mathematical fields. Ramanujan's work is characterized by profound insights and intuitive leaps, showcasing his extraordinary genius and leaving an indelible mark on the realm of mathematics.

                <h3 class="title text-centre font-weight-bold">Ramanujan number</h3>
                <p class="history">
                    The Ramanujan number, often referred to as the "Ramanujan-Hardy number" or the "taxicab number," is 1729. This number is particularly noteworthy due to its special property of being the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two distinct ways: 1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³. This mathematical curiosity emerged from a conversation between Srinivasa Ramanujan and G.H. Hardy, and it stands as a testament to Ramanujan's ability to find intriguing mathematical patterns even in everyday occurrences. The Ramanujan number exemplifies Ramanujan's remarkable talent for identifying hidden mathematical significance in seemingly ordinary observations.

                <p class="history">
                    Srinivasa Ramanujan's health was compromised during his time in England due to the harsh climate and diet changes, resulting in malnutrition, respiratory issues, and weakness. Despite these challenges, he continued producing groundbreaking mathematical work. Returning to India in 1919 didn't significantly improve his health, and he tragically passed away in 1920 at 32 due to persistent health complications. Despite his health struggles, Ramanujan's enduring legacy in mathematics continues to inspire, reminding us of his exceptional determination and the remarkable depth of his contributions to fields such as number theory and infinite series. His ability to create mathematical formulas and theorems, even amid health adversities, highlights his unparalleled genius and profound impact on the world of mathematics.
